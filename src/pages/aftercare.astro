        <div class="callout info">
          <h3>Heads up</h3>
          <p>
            All artists apply Saniderm immediately after your session. If you
            have adhesive or latex allergies, tell us before your appointment so
            we can wrap with a traditional bandage.

        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li>
            <span class="step-badge">24-48h</span>
            Leave the bandage on for 24–48 hours. Seeing plasma, ink, or blood collect
            under the film is normal—don’t peel it early.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="step-badge">Release</span>
            Gently push pooled fluid toward the edge and blot with a clean towel
            if it becomes uncomfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="step-badge">Shower safe</span>
            Saniderm is water-resistant—quick showers are fine. Skip soaking, baths,
            pools, or hot tubs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="step-badge">Remove</span>
            Peel the bandage off slowly in the shower under lukewarm water, pulling
            it back over itself—not straight up.
          </li>

          <h3>Lotion routine</h3>
          <p>
            After removing Saniderm, apply a thin layer of unscented moisturizer
            (Aquaphor, Lubriderm, etc.) 2–3 times daily for two weeks or until
            skin normalizes. Less is more—avoid clogging pores.

        </div>
        <ul class="emoji-list">
          <li>
            <span>☀️</span>
            Avoid direct sun, tanning beds, and harsh UV until fully healed. If you
            must go outside, cover the area.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>🏃</span>
            Skip the gym, pools, and high-sweat activities for 4–5 days while it’s
            bandaged. Too soon risks infection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>🚫</span>
            Do not scratch, pick, or peel flaking skin. Let the healing cycle run
            naturally to protect detail and color.

            Once healed, apply SPF 15+ whenever you’re in the sun. UV rays break
            down pigment rapidly. Keep skin hydrated year-round.
