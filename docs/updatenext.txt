Overall Site Architecture Review
What's Working:

The separate pages make sense: Gallery, FAQ, Contact, Events, Blog (Studio Stories), Aftercare
Each page has a clear, focused purpose
The design consistency across pages is strong
The dark aesthetic is maintained throughout

Critical Issues:
1. Homepage is Still Overloaded
The homepage should be simplified to:

Hero with catharsis message
3-4 key services (from "What We Offer")
One powerful visual (gallery preview or featured work)
Single strong CTA to book
That's it

Move to other pages:

"Studio Stories" cards → Blog page (you already have this!)
Full "Our Approach" breakdown → FAQ or About page
Gallery section → You have a gallery page
Community Care → Could be on About/Events
Merchandise → Needs its own Shop page or remove from site flow

2. The Gallery Page Needs Work

Only showing 7 images is underwhelming for a portfolio
No filtering/categories visible
The layout feels cramped
Consider: Grid with lightbox, categories (Tattoo Work, Piercings), artist attribution

3. FAQ Page is Excellent

Well-organized with clear categories
Comprehensive without being overwhelming
Good use of cards
This is your best-structured page

4. Contact Page Issues

Too many contact options competing (two separate forms/cards)
Simplify to ONE clear path: "Schedule Your Session" or general contact
The "Why attend right now?" section feels odd on a contact page

5. Events Page

The embedded scheduler is good
Community collaborators section is interesting
This page works well as-is

6. Blog/Studio Stories

Good structure with filtering
Empty state (black boxes) suggests content isn't ready
This is fine once populated

7. Aftercare Page is Perfect

Clear, scannable information
Well-organized by time periods
Warning signs prominently displayed
No changes needed here

Priority Recommendations:
Immediate:

Drastically simplify homepage (remove 4-5 sections)
Create dedicated "About" page for studio philosophy, approach, community care
Consolidate contact page to one clear form/path
Expand gallery with more images and better organization
Either create a proper Shop page for merchandise or remove it from navigation

Your Current Structure Should Be:

Home - Hero, services overview, one visual, CTA
About - Studio philosophy, approach, community work, team/artists
Services - Detail on tattoos, piercings, consultation process
Gallery - Portfolio with filtering
FAQ - Keep as-is
Blog/Stories - Keep as-is
Events - Keep as-is
Aftercare - Keep as-is
Contact/Book - One clear booking path
Shop (optional) - If keeping merchandise

The site is 80% there. The main issue is the homepage trying to be everything at once. Would you like me to create a streamlined homepage mockup
