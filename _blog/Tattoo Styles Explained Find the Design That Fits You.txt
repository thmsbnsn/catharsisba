Tattoo Styles Explained: Find the Design That Fits You
If you’re getting your first tattoo or adding to your collection, understanding tattoo styles helps you find your perfect fit.

Traditional Old School
Bold lines, limited color palettes, and timeless icons like roses, anchors, or daggers. This style ages beautifully and tells a story at first glance.

Black and Grey
Shaded tones without color — dramatic, subtle, and expressive. Great for portraits and detailed work.

Neo-Traditional
Think classic tattoo elements with modern color gradients and realism. Perfect for people who want vibrant art with a timeless backbone.

Minimalist or Fine Line
Simple, elegant designs that highlight precision. Ideal for subtle placements like wrists, collarbones, or ankles.
