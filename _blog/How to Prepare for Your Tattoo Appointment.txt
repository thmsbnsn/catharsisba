How to Prepare for Your Tattoo Appointment
Preparation makes a huge difference in how your tattoo looks and heals. Here’s how to get ready for your appointment at Catharsis Body Art.

The Night Before
Stay hydrated
Eat a balanced meal — low blood sugar leads to dizziness
Get a full night’s rest
What to Bring
ID and payment method
Snacks and water if it’s a long session
Comfortable clothing that gives your artist access to the area being tattooed
Avoid Beforehand
Alcohol, aspirin, and caffeine thin the blood — skip them at least 24 hours prior.

During Your Session
Relax. Trust your artist. Your comfort and communication are key.
