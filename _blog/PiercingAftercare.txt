Piercing Aftercare 101: Keep It Clean, Keep It Stylish
A piercing may look simple, but it’s still a wound that needs care. Proper aftercare prevents infection and ensures your jewelry stays beautiful.

Cleaning Routine
Use a sterile saline solution twice a day. Gently clean around the jewelry with a cotton pad — never twist or spin the jewelry during healing.

What to Avoid
Alcohol or hydrogen peroxide (they dry out tissue)
Submerging in pools or lakes
Changing jewelry too early
Healing Timeframes
Lobes can heal in 6–8 weeks. Cartilage, nostril, and navel piercings take longer — sometimes 6 months or more.

Trust Your Piercer
At Catharsis Body Art, our piercers use only professional-grade equipment and jewelry to minimize healing issues.
