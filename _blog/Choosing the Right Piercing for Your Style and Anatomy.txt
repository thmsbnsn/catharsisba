Choosing the Right Piercing for Your Style and Anatomy
Whether it’s a subtle stud or a bold septum ring, every piercing should complement both your anatomy and your personality. At Catharsis Body Art in Brownsburg, we make sure it does.

Ear Piercings
From lobes to industrials, each has its own vibe. Want something elegant and simple? A helix or tragus piercing is a clean, minimal choice.

Facial Piercings
Nose, eyebrow, lip — each placement changes how your expression is framed. Your piercer will help determine what fits your face best.

Body Piercings
Placement and jewelry type matter for comfort and healing. Quality titanium or implant-grade steel helps reduce irritation and infection.

Final Thought
Piercings are an art of balance between creativity and anatomy — get both right, and it’s pure self-expression.
