The Art of Healing: What to Expect After Getting a Tattoo
Your tattoo is more than body art — it’s an open wound that needs care to heal properly. At Catharsis Body Art in Brownsburg, we guide every client through the healing process to keep your ink vibrant for years to come.

Day 1: The First 24 Hours
After your tattoo session, your artist will clean the area, apply an ointment, and wrap it for protection. Keep the wrap on for the time your artist recommends (usually 2–4 hours). Once removed, gently wash with fragrance-free soap and warm water — no scrubbing.

Days 2–7: Let It Breathe
As the tattoo begins to heal, scabs and flaking are normal. Avoid picking or scratching. Use a thin layer of unscented lotion or tattoo balm twice a day.

What to Avoid
Direct sunlight and tanning beds
Swimming pools, saunas, or long baths
Tight clothing that rubs against your tattoo
Pro Tip
Healthy healing equals long-lasting color. Follow your artist’s instructions exactly — they’re your best resource.
